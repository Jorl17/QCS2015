/**
 * This class was based on an interface developed by Raul Barbosa and Henrique Madeira for the Software Quality and
 * Dependability course in the Master's Degree in Informatics Engineering. The mentioned interface describes a highly
 * simplified insulin dose calculator.
 *
 * Patients with type-2 diabetes need periodic insulin injections to help
 * process blood sugar. It is critical to be able to provide enough insulin to
 * metabolize the carbohydrates obtained from food, and even more critical to
 * never inject higher doses that may cause hypoglycemia, potentially leading to
 * coma and brain damage.
 *
 * One of the fundamental goals is to maintain a target blood sugar level
 * throughout the day, somewhere between 80 mg/dl and 120 mg/dl (constant for a
 * given patient, as prescribed by the doctor). Patients regularly measure the
 * blood glucose level and calculate the necessary insulin.
 *
 * Classes implementing this interface should use floating point arithmetic
 * internally for all calculations, with results rounded to the nearest integer.

     * Calculates the number of insulin units needed after one meal.
     *
     * This method takes the amount of carbohydrate in a given meal, and returns
     * the number of units of insulin needed after that meal. The returned
     * number of units of insulin equals the carbohydrate dose plus the high
     * blood sugar dose, which are computed as follows.
     *
     * The carbohydrate dose equals the total grams of carbohydrates in the meal
     * divided by the amount of carbohydrate disposed by one unit of insulin,
     * corrected by taking into account the personal sensitivity to insulin.
     * This dose equals carbohydrateAmount / carbohydrateToInsulinRatio /
     * personalSensitivity x 50.
     *
     * The high blood sugar dose equals the difference between the pre-meal
     * blood sugar level and the target blood sugar level, divided by the
     * personal sensitivity to insulin. This equals (preMealBloodSugar -
     * targetBloodSugar) / personalSensitivity. The personal sensitivity
     * may be estimated using personalSensitivityToInsulin().
     *
     * In the special case when the target blood sugar level is greater than the
     * pre-meal blood sugar level, the return value of this method is zero (no
     * insulin).

     * Determines an individual's sensitivity to one unit of insulin.

     * One unit of insulin typically drops blood sugar by 50 mg/dl, but this
     * value depends on each individual's sensitivity and daily physical
     * activity. This method predicts the blood sugar drop (in mg/dl) that will
     * result from one unit of insulin, for a given physical activity level.
     *
     * To predict the blood sugar drop, this method accepts two arrays with
     * K samples of (physical activity level, blood sugar drop). The two arrays
     * must therefore have the same length. First, a simple linear regression
     * (least squares method) is performed to compute alpha and beta. Then, the
     * return value is <code>alpha + beta x physicalActivityLevel</code>.
     *
     * The physical activity levels, including the ones in the array of samples,
     * and the blood sugar drop values are non-negative integers. The return
     * value of this method may be passed to mealtimeInsulinDose()
     * as a parameter.
